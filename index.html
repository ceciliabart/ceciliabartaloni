            <h4 class="pc">I contribute to the design and development of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes at IPU New Zealand. My academic background is in Tourism Marketing, and my research explores how emotions, memory, and technology shape memorable tourism experiences. Grounded in consumer behaviour and experience economy theories, my work aims to inform marketing strategy and support digital innovation in tourism. I completed a PhD in Management and Economics at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in 2024.</h4>

        <h4> Published on the <a class="journal" href="https://link.springer.com/journal/43039"target="_blank"> Italian Journal of Marketing </a>
         with Valerio Veglio, 2025 </h4>
      <p>Smart hotel technologies, such as smart environments and location-based mobile notifications could be used to encourage sustainable behaviours. 
        However, hotel guests might not enjoy interacting with these technologies, while hotel managers might see them as a cost. The aim of the paper is to explore the interrelationship
        between the hedonic value of smart hotels, and customer intention to use sustainable technologies. The results show that customers displaying a higher affinity for technology 
        are more likely to associate positive anticipated emotions with smart hotels and to adopt sustainable technologies, but not to pay for them.</p></div>

         with Linda Osti  and Charles Frederick Hofacker, 2025 </h4>
      <p>Memorable experiences have received considerable attention in tourism research. 
        Yet, there is a lack of a consensus among scholars regarding the elements within 
        the servicescape that contribute to their creation.
         Based on this research gap, the present study aims at understanding which elements within the servicescape
          have a greater impact on guests’ emotions when recalling memorable hotel experiences.The results show that the recollection of negative emotions in memorable experiences appears 
           to be affected by the physical and social dimension of the service environment and influenced by 
           the fading affect bias.</p></div>

          <h3><a class="journal" href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/455710" target="_blank">Are customers ready to be smart? Designing smart hotel experiences</a></h3>
          <h4> Published on <a class="journal" href="https://thm.fthm.hr/"target="_blank">Tourism and Hospitality Management</a>
         with Marco Alderighi, 2024</h4>
        <p> This paper aims to understand how smart hotels can be conceptualised based on customer preferences. To achieve this goal, the paper conceptualises smart hotels 
        as a service network in which the customer comes into contact with a variety of onsite technological and traditional touchpoints. This conceptualisation allows the researcher to observe 
        customer preferences at different touchpoints and identify the technologies that are central to 
        the development of the customer experience.The results show that the ideal customer journey includes both traditional and 
        technological touchpoints and that artificial intelligence is of central importance for the development of the smart hotel 
        concept.
